TagServer - a local server component that keeps track of the metadata of your
multimedia files. The server component is implemented as a Scala Actor.

Basic usage patterns:

1) Start the tagserver.server.TagServer actor 
2) Tell the TagServer actor where you keep your multimedia files with the AddBaseDirectory message
3) Request the TagServer actor to reload its database by sending it the ReloadTagsRequest message
4) Query the tag database via the GetTagsRequest and SearchRequest messages as you please

To out the system, compile and run the tagserver.CLI class with Scala command
line tools or within Eclipse via Run As -> Scala Application. This will launch
an interactive prompt that you can use to interact with the system.
